# LAB - 11

## Bus Mall

This is my lab 11 project to create an app to give visitors the options to vote on the products they'd most likely purchase to help give BusMall market analysis on products to keep. Seletions are stored to local storage and votes will be aggregated in a chart that will track how many times an item has been viewed and clicked.
